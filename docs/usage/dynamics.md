# Dynamics

By default, the dynamic terms in an amplitude model are set to $1$ by the
{class}`.HelicityAmplitudeBuilder`. The method {meth}`.set_dynamics` can then
be used to set dynamics lineshapes for specific resonances.

In the following pages, we show how to insert custom dynamics and illustrate
some of the lineshapes provided by {mod}`ampform`.
