"""JSON validation schema for `dict` instances that come from old XML files.

While support for XML will be slowly phased out (it was previously required by
`pycompwa`), the `expertsystem` internally still works with a specific nested
`dict` structure. This is most problematic in the `.particle` module â€” the
starting point for the expertsystem. This module helps validating the structure
of such nested `dict` instances.
