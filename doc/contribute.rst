How to contribute?
==================

If you have installed the `expertsystem` in :ref:`install:Development mode`, it
is easy to tweak the source code and try out new ideas immediately, because the
source code is considered the 'installation'.

.. note::

  The easiest way to contribute, is by using :ref:`Conda <install:Conda
  environment>` and :ref:`contribute:Visual Studio code`. In that case, the
  complete developer install procedure becomes:

  .. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem.git
    code expertsystem
    conda env create
    conda activate es
    pip install -e .[dev]

  For more info, see :ref:`contribute:Visual Studio code`.

When working on the source code of the `expertsystem`, it is highly recommended
to install certain additional Python tools. Assuming you installed the
`expertsystem` in :ref:`development mode <install:Development mode>`, these
additional tools can be installed into your :ref:`virtual environment
<install:Step 2: Create a virtual environment>` in one go:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install -e .[dev]

Most of the tools that are installed with this command use specific
configuration files (e.g. `pyproject.toml
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/blob/master/pyproject.toml>`_ for
`black <https://black.readthedocs.io/>`_, `.pylintrc
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/blob/master/.pylintrc>`_ for `pylint
<http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_, and `tox.ini
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/blob/master/tox.ini>`__ for `flake8
<https://flake8.pycqa.org/>`_ and `pydocstyle <http://www.pydocstyle.org/>`_).
These config files **define our convention policies**. If you run into
persistent linting errors this may mean we need to further specify our
conventions. In that case, it's best to create an issue and propose a policy
change that can then be formulated in the config files.


Pre-commit
----------

All **style checks** are enforced through a tool called `pre-commit
<https://pre-commit.com/>`__. This tool needs to be activated, but only once
after you clone the repository:

.. code-block:: shell

  pre-commit install

Upon committing, :code:`pre-commit` now runs a set of checks as defined in the
file `.pre-commit-config.yaml
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml>`_
over all staged files. You can also quickly run all checks over *all* indexed
files in the repository with the command:

.. code-block:: shell

  pre-commit run -a

This command is also run on Travis CI whenever you submit a pull request,
ensuring that all files in the repository follow the conventions set in the
config files of these tools.


Testing
-------

More thorough checks (that is, **runtime tests**) can be run in one go with the
command

.. code-block:: shell

  tox

This command will run :code:`pytest`, check for test coverage, build the
documentation, and verify cross-references in the documentation and the API.
It's especially recommended to *run tox before submitting a pull request!*

More specialized :code:`tox` tests are defined in the `tox.ini
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/blob/master/tox.ini>`__ file, under
each :code:`testenv`.

Try to keep test coverage high. You can compute current coverage by running

.. code-block:: shell

  pytest \
    --cov-report=html \
    --cov-report=xml \
    --cov=expertsystem

and opening :file:`htmlcov/index.html` in a browser. In VScode, you can
visualize which lines in the code base are covered by tests with the `Coverage
Gutters
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters>`_
extension (for this you need to run :code:`pytest` with the flag
:code:`--cov-report=xml`).


Documentation
-------------

The documentation that you find on `expertsystem.rtfd.io
<http://expertsystem.rtfd.io>`_ are built from the `documentation source code
folder <https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/tree/master/doc>`_ (:file:`doc`)
with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_. Sphinx also builds the API and
therefore checks whether the `docstrings
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ in the Python source code are
valid and correctly interlinked.

You can quickly build the documentation from the root directory of this
repository with the command:

.. code-block:: shell

  tox -e doc

If you want to render the output of the `Jupyter notebook examples
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/tree/master/examples>`_, this can be
done with:

.. code-block:: shell

  tox -e docnb

This takes more time than :code:`tox -e doc`, because it will execute the
notebooks. Alternatively, you can run :code:`sphinx-build` yourself as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

  cd doc
  make html  # or NBSPHINX_EXECUTE= make html

A nice feature of `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_, where we host
our documentation, is that documentation is built for each pull request as
well. This means that you can view the documentation for your changes as well.
For more info, see `here
<https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/autobuild-docs-for-pull-requests.html>`__,
or just click "details" under the RTD check once you submit your PR.


Spelling
--------

Throughout this repository, we follow American English (`en-us
<https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/>`_) spelling
conventions. As a tool, we use `cSpell
<https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell/blob/master/packages/cspell/README.md>`_
because it allows to check variable names in camel case and snake case.  This
way, a spelling checker helps you in avoid mistakes in the code as well!

Accepted words are tracked through the :file:`cspell.json` file. As with the
other config files, :file:`cspell.json` formulates our conventions with regard
to spelling and can be continuously updated while our code base develops. In
the file, the :code:`words` section lists words that you want to see as
suggested corrections, while :code:`ignoreWords` are just the words that won't
be flagged. Try to be sparse in adding words: if some word is just specific to
one file, you can `ignore it inline
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell#ignore>`_, or you can add the file to the
:code:`ignorePaths` section if you want to ignore it completely.

It is easiest to use cSpell in :ref:`contribute:Visual Studio Code`, through
the `Code Spell Checker
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>`_
extension: it provides linting, suggests corrections from the :code:`words`
section, and enables you to quickly add or ignore words through the
:file:`cspell.json` file. Alternatively, you can `run cSpell
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell#installation>`__ on the entire code base
(with :code:`cspell $(git ls-files)`), but for that your system requires `npm
<https://www.npmjs.com/>`_.


Git
---

* Please use
  `conventional commit messages <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/>`_: start
  the commit with a semantic keyword (see e.g. `Angular
  <https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type>`_ or
  `these examples <https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages>`_,
  followed by `a column <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers>`_,
  then the message. The message itself should be in imperative mood â€” just
  imagine the commit to give a command to the code framework. So for instance:
  :code:`feat: add coverage report tools` or :code:`fix: remove ...`.

* In the master branch, each commit should compile and be tested. In your own
  branches, it is recommended to commit frequently (WIP keyword), but squash
  those commits upon submitting a merge request.


Python conventions
------------------

* Follow :pep:`8` conventions.

* Any Python file that's part of a module should contain (in this order):

  1. A docstring describing what the file contains and does, followed by two
  empty lines.

  2. A definition of `__all__
     <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package>`_,
     so that you can see immediately what this Python file defines, **followed
     by two empty lines**.

  3. Only after these come the :code:`import` statements, following the
     :pep:`8` conventions for imports.

* When calling or defining multiple arguments of a function and multiple
  entries in a data container, split the entries over multiple lines and end
  the last entry with a comma, like so:

  .. code-block:: python

    __all__ = [
        'core',
        'optimizer',
        'physics',
        'plot',
    ]

  This is to facilitate eventual `diff <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff>`_
  comparisons in Git.


Visual Studio code
------------------

We recommend using `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ as
it's free, regularly updated, and very flexible through it's wide offer of user
extensions.

If you add or open this repository as a `VSCode workspace
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces>`_, the file
`.vscode/settings.json
<https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json>`_
will ensure that you have the right developer settings for this repository. In
addition, VSCode will automatically recommend you to install a number of
extensions that we use when working on this code base (they are `defined
<https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_6#_workspace-extension-recommendations>`__
:file:`.vscode/extensions.json` file).

You can still specify your own settings in `either the user or encompassing
workspace settings <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings>`_,
as the VSCode settings that come with this are folder settings.
