Installation
============

There are two ways to install `expertsystem`. Even though the PyPI installation
is the most convenient, we recommend following the :ref:`interactive
installation <installation:Interactive installation>` procedure.


Installation through PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attention::

  `expertsystem` is currently under development, so there currently exists no
  PyPI package!

`expertsystem` is `available as a PyPI package <https://pypi.org/>`_ so
installation is super easy:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install expertsystem

Et voil√†, that's it! You can try out whether the installation works by running:

.. code-block:: python

  import expertsystem

from the Python interpreter. Note that PyPI **only allows you to install
specific releases**, so we recommend using the more dynamic, :ref:`'interactive
installation' <installation:Interactive installation>` instead.


Interactive installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`expertsystem` is an academic research project and is bound to continuously
evolve. We therefore highly recommend installing `expertsystem` from `the
source code <https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem>`_, so that you work with
the latest version.

Moreover, since you read as far as this, you must have an interest in
partial-wave analysis, and it is researchers like you who can help bring this
project further! So please, have a look through the following sections to set
up this 'interactive installation':

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  install/get-the-source-code
  install/virtual-environment
  install/install

After that, it's worth having a look at the :doc:`contribute tutorials
<contribute>`!
